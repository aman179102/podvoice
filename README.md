# 🧠 **Podvoice**

Local-first, open-source CLI that turns simple Markdown scripts into
**multi-speaker audio** using **Coqui XTTS v2**.

Podvoice is built for developers who want a **boring, reliable, offline**
text-to-speech workflow — no cloud APIs, no subscriptions, no vendor lock-in.

Runs on **Linux, Windows, macOS, and FreeBSD**.

---

## Why Podvoice exists

* Most modern TTS tools depend on proprietary cloud services
* Developers want reproducible, script-based workflows
* Podcasts and narration should not require paid APIs

Podvoice is intentionally:

* Small
* Honest
* Hackable
* Local-first

No training pipelines.
No research code.
Just a clean CLI built on stable open-source components.

---

## Features

* **Markdown-based scripts**
* **Multiple logical speakers**
* **Deterministic voice assignment**
* **Single stitched output file**
* **WAV or MP3 export**
* **Local-only inference**
* **CPU-first (GPU optional)**
* **Cross-platform support**

## Supported platforms

| Platform | Status            | Notes                  |
| -------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| Linux    | ✅ Fully supported | Primary dev platform   |
| macOS    | ✅ Fully supported | Intel + Apple Silicon  |
| Windows  | ✅ Fully supported | PowerShell             |
| FreeBSD  | ✅ Supported       | Requires ffmpeg        |
| WSL2     | ✅ Supported       | Recommended on Windows |

---

## Input format

Podvoice consumes Markdown files with speaker blocks:

```markdown
[Host | calm]
Welcome to the show.

[Guest | warm]
If this sounds useful, try writing your own script
and see how easily Markdown becomes audio.
```

Rules:

* Speaker name is **required**
* Emotion tag is **optional**
* Text continues until the next speaker block
* Blank lines are allowed


---

## Quick start (ALL operating systems)

### 1️⃣ System requirements (common)

Required everywhere:

* **Python 3.10.x**
* **ffmpeg**
* Internet access **only for first run**
* ~5–8 GB free disk space (model cache)

---

### 2️⃣ Install system dependencies

#### 🐧 Linux (Ubuntu / Debian)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3.10 python3.10-venv ffmpeg git
```

---

#### 🍎 macOS (Homebrew)

```bash
brew install python@3.10 ffmpeg git
```

---

#### 🪟 Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
winget install Python.Python.3.10
winget install ffmpeg
winget install Git.Git
```

Restart the terminal after installing Python.

---

#### 🐡 FreeBSD

```sh
pkg install python310 ffmpeg git
```

---

### 3️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aman179102/podvoice.git
cd podvoice
```

---

## Setup (recommended path)

### 🐧 Linux / 🍎 macOS / 🐡 FreeBSD

```bash
chmod +x bootstrap.sh
./bootstrap.sh
```

This script will:

* Verify Python 3.10
* Create a local `.venv`
* Install fully pinned dependencies from `requirements.lock`
* Install `podvoice` in editable mode

---

### 🪟 Windows (PowerShell)

#### One-time: allow local scripts

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

#### Run bootstrap

```powershell
.\bootstrap.ps1
```

---

### Activate the environment

#### Linux / macOS / FreeBSD

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### Windows

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

---

## Run the demo

```bash
podvoice examples/demo.md --out demo.wav
```

Or export MP3:

```bash
podvoice examples/demo.md --out demo.mp3
```

On first run, Coqui XTTS v2 model weights will be downloaded and cached locally.
Subsequent runs reuse the cache.

---

## CLI usage

```bash
podvoice SCRIPT.md --out OUTPUT
```

Examples:

```bash
podvoice examples/demo.md --out output.wav
```

```bash
podvoice examples/demo.md --out podcast.mp3 --language en --device cpu
```

### Options

| Option             | Description               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| `SCRIPT`           | Input Markdown file       |
| `--out`, `-o`      | Output `.wav` or `.mp3`   |
| `--language`, `-l` | XTTS language code        |
| `--device`, `-d`   | `cpu` (default) or `cuda` |

---

## GPU usage (optional)

If you have a compatible NVIDIA GPU:

```bash
podvoice examples/demo.md --device cuda
```

If CUDA is unavailable, Podvoice safely falls back to CPU.

---

## Performance notes

You may see warnings like:

```
Could not initialize NNPACK! Reason: Unsupported hardware.
```

✔️ These are **harmless**
✔️ Audio generation will still complete
❌ No action required

---

## How voices are assigned

Podvoice does **not** train voices.

Instead:

* Uses built-in XTTS v2 speakers
* Hashes speaker names deterministically
* Maps each logical speaker to a stable voice

Implications:

* Same speaker name → same voice
* Rename speaker → possibly different voice
* XTTS update → mapping may change

Fallback: default XTTS voice.

## Responsible use

Podvoice generates natural-sounding speech.

Do **not**:

* Impersonate real people without consent
* Use generated audio for fraud or deception

Always disclose synthesized content where appropriate.

You are responsible for compliance with all applicable laws and licenses,
including those of Coqui XTTS v2.

## Contributing

Podvoice is intentionally simple.

Good contributions:

* Bug reports with minimal reproduction scripts
* CLI UX improvements
* Documentation clarity
* Cross-platform fixes

Non-goals:

* Cloud dependencies
* Training pipelines
* Over-engineering

**Goal:** local, boring, reliable software.
