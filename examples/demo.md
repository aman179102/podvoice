Hello, and welcome to the Podvoice demo.
This is a short example showing how a simple Markdown file
can be turned into podcast-style audio.

[Guest | curious]
Exactly. Instead of using cloud dashboards or external APIs,
everything you hear here is generated locally on this machine.

[Host | calm]
You just write a script with clear speakers,
run a single command,
and Podvoice takes care of voice assignment and stitching.

[Guest | upbeat]
It works well for narration, conversations,
or experimenting with small podcast ideas,
without setting up a complex pipeline.

[Host | warm]
If this sounds useful, try writing your own script
and see how easily Markdown becomes audio.
